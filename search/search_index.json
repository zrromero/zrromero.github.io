It was designed with the goal of consolidating the recent advances in web technologies into a single, definitive, math-on-the-web platform supporting the major browsers and operating systems.  It requires no setup on the part of the user (no plugins to download or software to install), so the page author can write web documents that include mathematics and be confident that users will be able to view it naturally and easily.  Simply include MathJax and some mathematics in a web page, and MathJax does the rest.</p> <p>Some of the main features of MathJax include:</p> <ul> <li> <p>High-quality display of LaTeX, MathML, and AsciiMath notation in HTML pages</p> </li> <li> <p>Supported in most browsers with no plug-ins, extra fonts, or special   setup for the reader</p> </li> <li> <p>Easy for authors, flexible for publishers, extensible for developers</p> </li> <li> <p>Supports math accessibility, cut-and-paste interoperability, and other   advanced functionality</p> </li> <li> <p>Powerful API for integration with other web applications</p> </li> </ul> <p>See http://www.mathjax.org/ for additional details about MathJax, and https://docs.mathjax.org for the MathJax documentation.</p>"},{"location":"static/node_modules/mathjax/#mathjax-components","title":"MathJax Components","text":"<p>MathJax version 3 uses files called components that contain the various MathJax modules that you can include in your web pages or access on a server through NodeJS.

For usage instructions, see the MathJax documentation.</p> <p>Components provide a convenient packaging of MathJax's modules, but it is possible for you to form your own custom components, or to use MathJax's modules directly in a node application on a server.

Indeed, you should be able to remove everything other than <code>tex-chtml.js</code>, and the <code>input/tex/extensions</code>, <code>output/chtml/fonts/woff-v2</code>, <code>adaptors</code>, <code>a11y</code>, and <code>sre</code> directories.  If you are using the results only on the web, you can remove <code>adaptors</code> as well.</p> <p>If you are not using A11Y support (e.g., speech generation, or semantic enrichment), then you can remove <code>a11y</code> and <code>sre</code> as well (though in this case you may need to disable the assistive tools in the MathJax contextual menu in order to avoid MathJax trying to load them when they aren't there).</p> <p>If you are using SVG rather than CommonHTML output (e.g., <code>tex-svg.js</code> rather than <code>tex-chtml.js</code>), you can remove the <code>output/chtml/fonts/woff-v2</code> directory.
