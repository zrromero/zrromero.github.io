# Introduction

Welcome to the repository of Zachary Romero, member of [**Team 305**](https://asu-egr314-2025-s-305.github.io/) for EGR314, currently working on an exciting project to design and develop a **line-following robot**.

## Team Members
- [Agilan Kumar's Datasheet](https://agilank24.github.io/)
- [Andrew Rushton's Datasheet](https://arushton96.github.io/)
- [David Diaz's Datasheet](https://daviddiaz01.github.io/)

## Project Overview

The line-following robot is designed to autonomously detect and follow a path using sensors and programmed logic. Itâ€™s a collaborative effort, with each team member taking responsibility for a specific system.

### My Role: Motor System Development

I am responsible for designing and implementing the **motor system** that powers the robot's movement via its wheels. This involves:
- Selecting and controlling motors to ensure smooth and precise movements.
- Integrating motor drivers and controllers to connect the motors to the microcontroller.
- Developing code to handle motor speed and direction adjustments.

## Goals and Challenges

Our primary goal is focussed towards the younger audience, where they will create a line. We will need to ensure that the robot can:
- Accurately follow lines in various conditions.
- Navigate corners and curves smoothly.

Our secondary goal is focussed towards an older audience, where we will create the line and they need to navigate it, to do this
