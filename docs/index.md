# Introduction

Welcome to the repository of **Team 305** in **EGR314**!

## About Me

Hello, my name is **Zachary Romero**, and I am a member of **Team 305**. Our team is currently working on an exciting project to design and develop a **line-following robot**.

## Project Overview

The line-following robot is designed to autonomously detect and follow a path using sensors and programmed logic. Itâ€™s a collaborative effort, with each team member taking responsibility for a specific system.

### My Role: Motor System Development

I am responsible for designing and implementing the **motor system** that powers the robot's movement via its wheels. This involves:
- Selecting and controlling motors to ensure smooth and precise movements.
- Integrating motor drivers and controllers to connect the motors to the microcontroller.
- Developing code to handle motor speed and direction adjustments.

## Goals and Challenges

Our primary goal is to ensure that the robot can:
- Accurately follow lines in various conditions.
- Navigate corners and curves smoothly.
